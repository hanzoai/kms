description: "Learn how to configure Hanzo KMS with custom certificates"
---

By default, the Hanzo KMS Docker image includes certificates from well-known public certificate authorities.
However, some integrations with Hanzo KMS may need to communicate with your internal services that use private certificate authorities.
To configure trust for custom certificates, follow these steps. This is particularly useful for connecting Hanzo KMS with self-hosted services like GitLab.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Standalone [Hanzo KMS image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ghcr.io/hanzoai/kms)
- Certificate public key `.crt` files

## Setup

1. Place all your public key `.crt` files into a single directory.
2. Mount the directory containing the `.crt` files to the `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` path in the Hanzo KMS container.
3. Set the following environment variable on your Hanzo KMS container:
   ```
   NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
   ```
4. Start the Hanzo KMS container.

By following these steps, your Hanzo KMS container will trust the specified certificates, allowing you to securely connect Hanzo KMS to your internal services.
