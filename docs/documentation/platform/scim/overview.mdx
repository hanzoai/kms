<Note>
  SCIM provisioning can only be enabled when either SAML or OIDC is setup for
  the organization.
</Note>
<Info>
  SCIM provisioning is a paid feature. If you're using Hanzo KMS Cloud, then it
  is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Hanzo KMS,
  then you should contact sales@kms.hanzo.ai to purchase an enterprise license
  to use it.
</Info>

You can configure your organization in Hanzo KMS to have users and user groups be provisioned/deprovisioned using [SCIM](https://scim.cloud/#Implementations2) via providers like Okta, Azure, JumpCloud, etc.

- Provisioning: The SCIM provider pushes user information to Hanzo KMS. If the user exists in Hanzo KMS, Hanzo KMS sends an email invitation to add them to the relevant organization in Hanzo KMS; if not, Hanzo KMS initializes a new user and sends them an email invitation to finish setting up their account in the organization.
- Deprovisioning: The SCIM provider instructs Hanzo KMS to remove user(s) from an organization in Hanzo KMS.
