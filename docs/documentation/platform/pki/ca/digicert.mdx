## Concept

Hanzo KMS can connect to [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/) using the [ACME-compatible CA integration](/documentation/platform/pki/ca/acme-ca) to issue certificates back to your end-entities.

## Guide to Connecting Hanzo KMS to DigiCert CA

To connect Hanzo KMS to DigiCert, follow the steps in the [ACME-compatible CA integration](/documentation/platform/pki/ca/acme-ca) guide but use the DigiCert **ACME Directory URL**: `https://acme.digicert.com/v2/acme/directory`.

DigiCert requires **External Account Binding (EAB)** for all ACME registrations. You will need to obtain both a Key Identifier (KID) and an HMAC Key from your DigiCert account before registering the ACME CA in Hanzo KMS.

DigiCert typically issues certificates with a 90-day validity period.
